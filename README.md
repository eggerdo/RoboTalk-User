# RoboTalk - User

A simple android application to control a robot over ZMQ and display its camera on the device. It requires a server to receive and send ZMQ command and video messages (see [Robot Server](https://github.com/eggerdo/robot_server.node)) and a robot which can be controlled with ZMQ (e.g. [RomoBrain](https://github.com/eggerdo/RomoBrain))
